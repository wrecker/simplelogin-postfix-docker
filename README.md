# Docker Image for SimpleLogin Postfix with certbot dns01 challenge

This is fork of [simplelogin-postfix-docker](https://github.com/simple-login/simplelogin-postfix-docker) that adds support for using DNS01 challenge with certbot.
Currently this docker image only support using the certbot [cloudflare dns plugin](https://certbot-dns-cloudflare.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

\* if a TLS certificate cannot be automatically generated when starting the container, Postfix will run without TLS activated, until the next attempt (happens every hour)

Can be configured with the following environment variables:

Setting     | Description
----------- | -------------------------------------------
**ALIASES_DEFAULT_DOMAIN** | Default domain to use for your aliases.
**DB_HOST** | Where is hosted your SimpleLogin PostgreSQL database.
**DB_USER** | User to connect to the database.
**DB_PASSWORD** | User's password to connect to the database.
**DB_NAME** | Name of the database.
**EMAIL_HANDLER_HOST** | Where is hosted your SimpleLogin email handler instance.
**LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL** | Email address used by Let's Encrypt, to send you expiry notices\*.
**POSTFIX_FQDN** | Fully Qualified Domain Name of your Postfix instance (i.e., the MX server address you configured in your DNS zone for your **ALIASES_DEFAULT_DOMAIN**).
**RELAY_HOST** | If your Postfix instance's IP address is blacklisted (e.g., because it is not a static address), you must use your Internet Service Provider's mail server as a relay, to be able to send emails to the outer world.

\* automatic renewal is managed with [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) and shouldn't fail, unless you have reached Let's Encrypt [rate limits](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/)

Used by and made for [Klo√ºgle](https://github.com/arugifa/klougle), the Google

## Using this image
Create an API Token in your cloudflare account with Zone Edit access restricted to the domain to use with this container. Create a file `dns-cloudflare-creds.ini` and save the
cloudflare API Token
```sh
# Cloudflare API token used by Certbot
dns_cloudflare_api_token = 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567
```
Now start the container with this image and mount the file into the container as `/.certbot/dns-cloudflare-creds.ini`

```
docker run -d --env-file ... -v <path-to-dns-cloudflare-creds.ini>:/.certbot/dns-cloudflare-creds.ini` simplelogin-postfix
```

## Troubleshooting

If you don't receive emails from SimpleLogin, have a look to Postfix logs:
```sh
docker logs -f <POSTFIX_CONTAINER>
```

If Postfix doesn't seem to use TLS, have a look to Certbot logs:
```sh
docker exec -ti <POSTFIX_CONTAINER> cat /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
```
